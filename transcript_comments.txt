The whole world is looking at Phoenix this weekend, and our starting weekend off 
right together. I think that there may be two of you in this auditorium tonight 
who came to watch Titanic, and 

ya have no clue why this guy keeps on grabbing the microphone and interrupting 
the movie, 
// Gaslighting; you have no clue, and he knows more about what you know than you 
// do.

but for the rest of you, I'm just guessing maybe, by any chance, are you apes? 
(audience shouting) (inaudible) By the way, I (giberish) these seats were all 
bought, but the people like one row behind you aren't here so you might be able 
to move back one to get a better view. Not yet. Let's wait and see what happens. 

Alright, um, folks. The last 3 years have been the craziest 3 years of our 
lives
// He knows nothing about what my life has been like in the past 3 years, how 
// about you? Do you think Adam has intimate knowledge about your life such that
// he has a real evidentuary basis for his statement, here? 

I wan' ya to take take you back to December of 2019.
// Touches head implies lying 

I don't wanna say that anybody in this room, or that AMC, was fat, dumb and 
happy, but we were fat, dumb and happy.
// Gaslighting; you're fat and dumb. I wonder if that is money? Are we dumb 
// money?

How oblivious were we to how our lives were gonna change? 
// Gaslighting; you were oblivious, according to him. He knows; you don't.

In a couple of months. Um.
// Touches head implies lying

I remember in February of 23.
// Gaslighting; 2020 = 2023, Covid just recently began, this year in February 
// 2023. Not in 2020, according to Adam. And what happened to 2019? He said he
// wanted to take us back to 2019, but now it's 2023, and the Covid pandemic is
// just beginning, now, not in 2020, but in 2023.

We got our first order from the City Fathers of Milan in Italy to close half a 
dozen theaters. 

That was February 23.
// Gaslighting; OK got it. 2020 = 2023, Covid is only just now beginning, now in
// 2023. It didn't happen in 2020; it's happening now. Thanks for repeating that.
// No one remembered when you said it the first time because we are dumb. So 
// Thanks, Adam.

And we had uh 1000 theaters at AMC; just under it, an' I thought, "Ahh well, 
that's no big deal. I mean we're closin'." 
// Gaslighting; AMC is closing? Which is it bro? "AMC was going to close 6 
// theaters in 2023, back in 2019," or is it just, "We (AMC) are closing, just 
// altogether?" When exactly is AMC closing again? Back in 2023? Or now in 2019? 
// Or before Covid in 2020? I am fat and dumb, so help me understand it! 

Remember we heard about Covid, sort of start... it was called the Coronavirus. 
And we sort of heard about it in January of 23. 
// Gaslighting; You didn't know Covid was a synonm for Coronavirus, and 
// 2020 = 2023, Covid is just starting, now, for the first time, now only. Not in 
// 2020. Just now, in 2023. Back before 2019. When you were dumb, according to 
// Adam

But it was in China, an it didn't look like it was leavin China. February
it jumped to Italy. It suddenly went from China to Italy, and took it with...
um... and even in February of 23 
// Gaslighting; Again! It's still 2020 = 2023, Covid jumped to Italy from China 
// for the first time, ever, just this year and just this month. In February 23.
// Be scared. Because Covid is just beginning, now, in 2023...

I remember thinking, um, "OK it's 6 theaters not 1000, it's not the end of the 
world." 3 weeks later... 3 weeks later 
// Epizeuxis; emotional appeal, setting the stage for the purpose of inspiring 
// motivation (to vote yes) 

AMC had to shut all 1000 of our theaters... (very loud noise; inaudible) 
...that we had in the entire world. In 3 weeks, and we went from a company 
that had 5 and a half billion dollars a year of revenue, very reliable, good 
times bad times. 5.4 billion, no problem. 800 million dropped on the bottom 
line, every year, no problem. In a week, in a week,
// Epizeuxis; emotional appeal, setting the stage for the purpose of inspiring 
// motivation (to vote yes) 

we went to having no revenue, at all. None. In a week. And we had shh... we 
still had bills, and we still had 30,000 employees, and we owed rent, on all the 
leases at 1000 theaters in a dozen countries, and on and on and on, 
// Epizeuxis; emotional appeal, setting the stage for the purpose of inspiring 
// motivation (to vote yes) 

and it became very clear... as as strong as our company was were duh... we were 
we still are the biggest movie theater chain in the world, we were gonna run out 
of cash in 90-days an' I'm like, "amazing," and we scrambled, and we raised a 
lot 

we raised 500 million dollars,
// 500 million dollars in triple-p bailout loans is "raising" money. What a 
// brilliant CEO. We are fat and dumb. 

and that bought us a few months, and then in July we raised another 300 million 
dollars that bought us a few more months, and in December we been raising money, 
raising money, raising money,
// Epizeuxis; emotional appeal, setting the stage for the purpose of inspiring 
// motivation (to vote yes)) 

staying alive... 
// Yeah, he diluted the stock a lot in 2020.
 
beating the sheriff by a day (ya know an'...)  ...uhh and everybody thought duh 
movie theaters were gonna come roaring back, but it didn't, and by December 2020 
my CFO and I (who's a he's a very talented guy) CFO is chief financial 
officer...
// Gaslighting; you didn't know the acronym CFO... you invest in the stock 
// Market, but you had no idea because you are fat and dumb retail money.
 
we realized that (we're ehh...) we kept on raising 2 300 million
// Touches head implies lying
// Gaslighting; 2 300 million is not a number. It seems like he's trying really
// hard to inspire irrational thinking...

dollars it wasn't enough. So we announced with some bravodo that we were gonna 
raise 700 'n' 50 million dollars... 
// Is that 700.50 million dollars, or 750 million dollars. Because "and" is 
// English syntax for the decimal point. So how is 50 cents 50 million dollars?

was gonna buy us... all the way t'uhh... 
March or April or May or something... 
// Really? This guy is CEO, but he doesn't know his own budget allocation, nor
// for how long it will last? Not just by a little bit, but by an entire quarter
// he has no idea? And it might not even be that? He just doesn't know. Seems 
// like he is very interested in the financials of this company. He has no idea
// what he can do with his cash reserves, nor does he know how long they will 
// last, and with such a lackadaisical demeanor...

um and if we didn't we might have to throw in the towel, but we didn't raise 700 
and 50 million dollars. We raised a billion 2...
// Touches head implies lying
// billion 2 is not a number. A lot of irrationality being communicated in all of
// this. Is he irrational, or does he want us to be irrational? I bet the later.

in 5 weeks. And then you arrived. b'cause we put out a press release on a Monday 
morning, in late January of 2021, sayin' we raised 1 point 2 billion dollars, 
and bankruptcy's off the table, and we've made it. 
// OK so the pandemic is over at this point because "we've made it." The question
// is which of the following is the current year? Is it 2024, 2023, 2020, or 
// 2019?
// Another question: does anyone know what press release he is talking about? AMC 
// is a meme stock like GME. We bought AMC for the meme stock short squeeze. He 
// doesn't seem to know or understand anything about his shareholder base, not 
// even after 2-years does he seem to know anything about us. Other than that we
// are dumb (money) and fat. Not to mention oblivious, and clueless.

And literally the next day... 
// Is that the post-hoc ergo proctor hoc fallacy? I think it is.

retail investors descended on AMC, an' the stock went from 2 dollars a share, 
where it was in early January, to 10 which is 5 times, an' it wen' t'uhh 20, 
which was 10 times, and then 30, and 40, and 50, and 60, and a lot of you, and 
your uhh fellow apes descended on AMC, and you decided that single-handedly you 
were gonna save this company, and you were gonna save movie going in America.
// Fallacy: appeal to vanity

// Fallacy: a long winded appeal to tradition fallacy as the premise to another 
// appeal to vanity fallacy
Let me tell ya' how important movie goin' in America is. People in this country
have been going to movies for a century... a century
// Epizeuxis; emotional appeal, setting the stage for the purpose of inspiring 
// motivation (to vote yes)) 

It's... other than going da an 'E' go out and eat a meal at a restaurant it is 
the second most popular thing to do out of home in the United States. In 2019, 
the movie industry total, not just AMC, sold a billion movie tickets. That's 3 
times a year for every man, woman, child, and baby in the United States. Tha' 
's a lot of tickets. Ya' wanna 'n 'uhh 'ow r'any tickets that is? We're here, 
by... duh in Phoenix, a lot of people, this weekend to see the Superbowl. If you 
take the attendence of every NFL team, every team, all season long, all the 
games, and you add that to the attendence of every NBA game, every team in the 
league, all season long, and every team in the NHL, and major league soccer, and 
even throw in the hundred 'n' 62 
// Gaslighting; 100.62 = 162. Is he even speaking in English right now? 

games that every baseball team plays in the United States, and in in and in the 
amount they... you take all of that... all those tickets... all those teams, all 
those cities, all those leagues... movie theaters sold 7 times that number of 
tickets, in 2019. So, (audience cheering) and... and... like, people like goin' 
to theaters, an' we kept reading in the press... um... 25 year old... dur 
journalists saying, "Aaaa, movie theaters were an anachronism no one want s 
t'go ta theaters. Well... wha... guess what the pandemic caused. When all of us 
were in prison in our houses or apartments for months on end. 
// Attempting to envoke an emotional response in the listener by referring to 
// Covid, yet again...

Like, your house is really nice, 
// Fallacy: appeal to vanity; setting the stage / buttering you up

but you wanna get out of it, and one of the things people do when they get out 
of the house is they go to a theater, they sit in these nice cushy seats, they 
get entertained, they get amused, they get to escape their daily lives... 
// So I guess people go to AMC to escape their lives, because people hate 
// living?

// Continuing the appeal to tradition...
movie going has been a big thing in this country for a 100 years, 
and what our retail investers decided is that you were gonna be damned if 
Wallstreet was gonna take us down 
// And there's that appeal to vanity, again, to get you really emotionally 
// charged. Don't use logic. Don't think about things. Just get lost in the 
// moment and bask in the feeling of a major CEO lavishing your ego. It's all 
// about you, and how you feel. Ignore all facts, always.

and you (audience cheering) you invest a lot of money, hard earned money, and... 
putting it our direction, and saying, "keep AMC strong," and that's exactly what 
we've been doing for almost 3 years now as we try to get past this horrible 
pandemic. 
// Gaslighting; he already said "we've made it. OK so the pandemic was over, I 
// guess in 2019 who in tf knows when, but now it isn't over and I guess the 
// current year is 2020?
 
Which, admittedly has hit the movie theater industry very hard. Because we know
what we are doing at AMC, and because we have your support... 
// Gaslighting arising from logical ambiguity: the theater industry was hit very
// hard because they know what they are doing at AMC, and because they have our
// support...
// Fallacy: appeal to false authority, appeal to vanity; if he knew what he was 
// doing, then he would know that projection estimates put AMC cash flow postive 
// in 2023. See the research paper. Moreover, he would know the catastrophic 
// consequences to retail shareholders of AMC that will be caused by the 
// reverse-split-conversion. He would know reverse-split-conversion would take 
// moass and any possibility of a squeeze off the table. He says he knows what 
// he is doing. I would have rather attributed it to naive incompetence; but 
// evidently, according to him, it is with malicious intent. Or he is 
// increduluous, which would beg the question: what is he even doing by being
// employeed as the CEO, of, well... anything at all? Much less of AMC.

at the end of the third quarter of 2022, September 30, (we haven't announced the 
December 31 results yet, we do that in a couple of weeks,) AMC had around 900 
million dollars of cash, the bank, or undrawn revolvin' credit line.
// Thank God, "AMC had 900 million dollars the bank," at the end of the third 
// quarter of 2022. Is it 2022, or 2019? Is he speaking in English? I am dumb
// money.
 
Contrast that with the number 2 player in the industry. Which is Regal here in 
the United States, an' Cineworld in Europe. (audience comment) They ran out of 
cash... (responding to audience) well ya've heard of Regal right? 
(audience) (inaudible...) ...you've heard of Regal. They ran out of money in 
September. They went to bankruptcy court. We had 900 million dollars in the 
bank. They had 4 million dollars in the bank. You can't run a company this 
big... with 4 million dollars.
// You can because companies run off cash flow, not cash reserves.

You'll run out of cash quicker than like 72 hours. 
// touches head implies lying

And while others in our industry failed... AMC was strong. 
// Others? He said Regal. So 1 failed, or more than 1 failed? Is the current 
// year 2019?
// Comparing to Regal is such an over simplified, and dumbed down way is the
// Weak Analogy Fallacy, but Adam says we were fat conspiracy theorists, so it's 
// cool.

(audience) Choke on that. (audience cheering) Choke on that. I agree. I agree. 
Uhh. We did it because the management team at AMC knows what we're doin',
// epizeuxis; emotional appeal, setting the stage for the purpose of inspiring 
// motivation (to vote yes)) 
// There is that same vacuous appeal to false authority. I want you to observe
// exactly what he is telling you here: he is saying they acquired 500 million
// in triple-p bailout forgivable loans, and diluted shareholders in 2020,
// because he (and the rest of the AMC management team) knows what they were 
// doing. Not for financial reasons, not according to him. HE IS SAYING, he did
// all of that, because he knows what he is doing, and also that is why Regal
// went bankrupt. It's because he knows what he is doing. 

and we did it because we have your support. So I'd like to ask you to do me a 
favor... take your right hand (I'm not gonna ask ya' to like a pledge or 
anything.) Take your right hand... put it behind your head... pat yourself on 
the back 'cause I'm tellin' ya' folks you saved AMC.
(audience cheering) (inaudible)
// It seems there is no limit to the number of appeals to vanity that this man
// will give you to butter you up, and by the audience reaction it is working.

Dur... We have a proposal right now... that will be voted on by our 
shareholders... to put together the so-called APE common uh uh the AMC common 
shares and the APE preferred units. 
// touches head implies lying

I just cannot strat-duh-die-votes on March 14th. 
// What did he just say? Is this in English?

You're all gonna get mailed proxy materials in the next couple of days. I just 
can't tell you how important it is that you vote yes... in this election, and 
you tell your friends if they are AMC shareholders to vote yes, and I am gonna 
explain why. 
// He really isn't going to explain why, and I am going to explain why.

Back in the summer the only reason the only reason we're here today is 'cause we 
were able to raise a lot of money. We were able to out last this pandemic, 
// OK so now the pandemic is over again. So that must mean the current year must
// be 2021. Back in which summer? This summer? THE summer is THIS summer. So the
// current year is definitely 2021.

and we tried in the summer of 2021 to raise a lot more money, and I urged 
shareholders to vote yes back then you may recall. If we would have sold a 
hundred and 25 million shares in the summer of 2021, to the general public, 
// Adam has diluted several times, but never has he sold his dilution shares to 
// the general public. He only sells them to his hedgefund friends.

we would have raised 5 billion dollars of cash, and AMC would be totally debt 
free today, and every short seller would be dead. (audience cheering) 
// False by the mathematical proof by counterexample: GameStop paid off their 
// debt, and they are still being just as heavily shorted. Paying off debt 
// doesn't cause shorts to die.
// Neither should we believe Adam cares about the debt.

Instead, though, we couldn't get the vote.
// Touches head implies lying
// Guilt tripping. It's your dumb money fault he didn't dilute the free float
// by 2 times its size in 2021, the current year.

and we did other things, and we're still here... we still have plenty of money, 
// Wait what? We're still here, and we (AMC) still has PLENTY OF MONEY even 
// without dilution? You don't say? How can that be possible when you told us in
// 2021 that you needed a half billion share dilution? Adam knows what he is 
// doing. He raised 500 million dollars in triple-p bailout forgivable loans.
// How is AMC still here when we never diluted in 2021? Oh I get it! The current
// year must be 2019. So it's the summer of 2019, and Covid is hitting AMC hard,
// so he needs dilution or AMC won't exist in 2022. Got it. I am fat and dumb.

but we still have 5 billion dollars of debt, and if we tried to sss... sell 100 
and 25 million shares now, 
// Gaslighting; so now 125 = 100.25
 
60 million APEs and 60 million AMC common, 
// Gaslighting; so now 125/2 = 60 

we wouldn't raise 5 billion dollars. We wouldn't even raise 500 million dollars. 
And it's a very different company because we didn't raise 5 billion dollars in 
the summer of 2021. 
// Formal fallacy: identity axiom: he says AMC is not AMC because he didn't get 
// 5 billion dollars from dilution in 2021, that he never needed because in his
// own words, "We (AMC) are still here, and we (AMC) have plenty of money."
// He knows what he is doing, because he said so. Just trust Lou bro. He has a
// secret connection, and we are fat and dumb.

uhh Having said that, if you vote when we announced this plan to put the APEs 
and the AMC common shares back together... 
// Here comes the red herring, and why would we not vote?

the APEs were trading on the open market, decided by market forces, whether you 
think the market forces are fair or unfair, the market is the 
market. 
// Gaslighting; we are fat and dumb. 

APEs were selling for 69 cents on December 21, the day before we announced the 
split. Those APEs have almost quadrupled in value in a month and a half. 
Quadrupled in value, 
// Epizeuxis; emotional appeal, setting the stage for the purpose of inspiring 
// motivation (to vote yes)
// Yeah he sold hundreds of millions of our equity at the market bottom of about
// 60 cents, and then the market price quadrupled. He knows what he is doing
// because he said so; just trust Lou bro. He's got secret connections.

because the plan to put the APE preferred units, and the AMC common shares back 
together. But let me tell ya', if we vote yes we will be able to raise a lot 
more money, and give up far fewer shares to do it,
// Or Adam could just quit obessing over diluting his shareholders because there 
// is no factual justification for it; AMC is projected estimate 2023 cash flow 
// positive with wide profit margins. See the research paper.

// Here comes the appeal to force; fear mongering fallacy; missing the point 
// fallacy
but if our shareholders vote no what goes up can go down. Those APEs were 
selling for 70 cents... a month ago, and they were trading at 2.40 today or
something, but they could go back down to 70 cents in a day if the shareholders
vote the wrong way, 
// Corretion: the right way
// From 2.40 to 70 cents in a single day? So a 70% market crash; in one day?
// And is anyone happy with APE trading at 2.40? We were issued APE at $10. 
// Only the apes who were able to cost-average down might care about that? We 
// can't sell at 2.40, and we can't sell at 70 cents. So who cares? Why do we 
// want to contaminate AMC just so our APE position is at a slightly less severe 
// loss at 2.40? 

and I don't want that to happen to you. I want your AMC shares, and your APE 
units... to be worth more money not less money, 
// RSC will make AMC worthless. If he cared so much about our money, amongst 
// many other things such as actually doing his actual job by improving 
// shareholder equity, he would have taken RSC off the table. He said he knows
// what he is doing. So that means he just doesn't care. 
// See the research paper, if you doubt that RSC will have catastrophic impacts
// on AMC shares.

and I wanna be able to raise money for AMC so we out last this pandemic, 
// OK so now the pandemic is happening again. He said it was over, not over, 
// over, and now it isn't over, again. Covid must have just jumped from China
// to Italy since the current year is 2023.
// He rationale is without factual basis. See the research paper link in the 
// description.

and do it at 2 or 3 dollars per share. 
// This guy's price target for AMC is 2 or 3 dollars... and that isn't shilly?

Not at 40 cents, 
// When has APE ever been 40 cents? More fear mongering. APE is going to 40 
// cents now. According to Adam. Does this sound like a silverback to you?
// It sounds like a shill to me. 1 cent any minute now, right guys? 
// Not only is it the Fear Mongering Fallacy, but it's also the Slippery Slope 
// Fallacy. We aren't doing a whole lot of braining here. Adam, said we are 
// dumb, so the math checks out.

or 50 cents,
// He won't give that Slippery Slop Fallacy up. Yes Adam, yes: keep confusing
// your dumb money shareholders. 

or 60 cents a share. Look, 'e 'ad t'uhh give out 4 or 5 times as many shares to 
raise the same amount of cash. 
// Is he speaking English? So don't give out 4 or 5 times as many shares. Don't
// give out any shares at all. Why would you? Why would a cash flow positive 
// company dilute their shareholders by 1 to 5 billion shares? Is this the 
// Twilight Zone? Wen logic?

So, that's the plea. We should as a company, as a community... we should've sold 
shares the summer of 2021, but we couldn't get the shareholders 
to say yes. 
// More guilt tripping. We didn't sell shares in the summer of 2021. We are 
// still here. I thought this paperhand said he knew what he was doing. 

We're trying again. We really need you to vote yes. Um, and if you
do vote yes what do I think is going to happen? 
// Touches head implies lying

// And here comes another red herring fallacy. He was going to tell us what 
// he thinks is going to happen, if we vote yes. Now, instead of telling us that
// he is going to give his thesis on why the broader market is down. Wen logic?
I don't know... if you know why... AMC shares have fallen so much in the last 
year, but there are a lot of reasons. One reason is just 2022 was the worst year 
for stocks, generally, not at AMC, not a movie theater, all stocks. It was the 
worst year for stocks in this country in 15 years. Why? 'cause interest rates 
are soaring, inflation is soaring, there's the war in Ukraine, energy prices 
are up, peoples mood is sour. Like, it's not a good, but that's one reason, 
// gaslighting; 1 reason = 5 reasons. 
// Fallacy of illicit transference: 

but theres a second reason. 
// gaslighting; he just gave 5 reasons. So 5 + 1 = 2. We are dumb money.

// Here we go. Back to blame shifting to Covid again...
The movie theater industry has recovered very slowly from Covid, and I'm gonna 
run some numbers by ya' real quick. 
// Yes, but he evidently doesn't understand numbers since the current year is
// 2019, and Covid starts in 2023, and because 6 = 2, according to Adam. So he
// clearly knows what he is doing. He said so. Just trust Lou bro.

The the basic size of the movie theater industry is denomiated by something 
called the domestic box office. The domestic box office is all ticket sales, 
all theaters, all brands in the United States, and Canada. There's sort'a 2 
numbers that everybody follows in the movie business: the domestic box office, 
and the global box office. Domestic is US and Canada, global is ever' where e'r. 
For 11 years in a row, from 2009 to 2019, the box office was larger, the 
domestic box office, was larger than 10 billion dollars. The last 5 years of 
those 11, from 2015 to 2019, the domestic box office was more than 11 billion 
dollars. Pretty stable, and growin'. What happened when Covid hit? The box 
office fell, in from 2019 11.4 billion, 2019 being the last full year before the 
pandemic, t'a 2 billion. 
// He suddenly knows the difference between which year is which. Thank God. I 
// thought he was just senile. So I guess he was confusing 2020 with 2023 on 
// purpose? He repeated that mistake 4 times. He said he knows what he is doing.

11 and a half billion to 2 billion, in a year. The next year, 2021, it was 4 and 
a half billion. That's up. That's more than double. That's good. It's a lot less 
than 11 billion. The year that was just completed, 2022, again it grew... t'a 
7.4 billion. It's a lot more than 4 point 5. It's a lot more than 2 point 'O',
but if ya' go back to the summ-I-did-guh be'uh pandemic 7 and a half billion is
// Is he speaking English?

still a lot less than 11 and a half billion, and so the recovery of the movie
theater industry has been slow. 

// Here comes another red herring; the pandemic is over again, whew! I was 
// worried! Thought it was going to be a repeat of the year 2023.
// More Covid talk. As if it isn't meant to inspire emotional thinking. Can any
// one explain to me what Covid has to do with balance sheet mathematics? Does
// arithmetic change depending on what Covid does? Is that how 2020 = 2023?
Now, back in 2020, people might not have been goin' to theaters because they 
were afraid t'uhh... be with people. But look at you all we're not wearing masks 
anymore. Like, we might elbow bump 'n' fist bump a little more than we shake 
hands, but like you're here together. You're not scared. A... you're not gonna 
catch Covid in this room. There's been an uhh immunity that's developed across 
the country. Herd immunity it's called. Plus, a lot of you are vaccinated, and 
there are drugs now where if you get Covid, called Paxlaviv... you can take a 
pill, but it'll I uhhh it it's tastes awful this pill... terrible t'a anyone who 
has ever taken it. But, like, it knocks out Covid in 12 hours. In 2020, Covid 
might have been a death sentence. Now it's just like a bad cold or a small flu. 
Very, very different. Uhh, but so like ages ago you guys might have been afriad 
to go to theaters. Not now. People are goin' to theaters. How do I know? 
Anybody see a movie called Top Gun Maverik? (audience cheering) It sold a 
billion and a half dollars in tickets in movie theaters. Anybody here go to a 
movie call Avatar the way of Water? It sold, in less than 2 months, 2.1 billion 
dollars in movie theaters. (audience shouting)
// So it sounds like the industry is doing really well... so what tf Adam?

People are going to theaters to see movies. As we all are tonight, 
// Touches head implies lying

but... here's the dirty little secret (not so secret) (mumbling; inaudible)
// What he says is not the dirty little secret; the dirty little secret
// is what he's not about to tell you which is: the per release revenue for 
// major Hollywood releases has increased by way over 10 times since Covid. See 
// the research paper.

If you look at the number of movies that major Hollywood studios released... in 
2019 it was around 120 movies or so. You know how many you know how many they 
released in 2022? 72. It's way down. Our problem isn't that people are afraid to 
go to theaters or that it's not safe to go to theaters. Our problem is just 
there are fewer movies being released, 
// Incorrect. There isn't a problem; none whatsoever: see the research paper.

but let's look ahead let's not look back. In 2023, the number of major movies 
that are gonna be released by major studios should be right around 100. That's a
35% jump above 72 movies that the industry released in 2022. So when you look at 
the box office in 2023 it's gonna be bigger than it was in 2022, and we (we've 
got a pretty good insight on this) we know what movies are coming in 2024, and 
there should be more movies coming out in 24 than there will be in 2023. So when 
you look at the movie theater industry... it's true that Covid knocked us on 
onto our knees in 2020,
// Gaslighting; he suddenly knows Covid happened in 2020, not 2023 

and it's probably gonna be a 5-year climb to get out of it; to get back
to where we once were, 
// This shilly AF statement is not at all supported by any facts. 2023 will be 
// cash flow positive with large profit margins. see the research paper

but... 21 was better than 20, 22 was better than 21, 23's
gonna be better than 22, 24's gonna be better than 2023, and so when I looked 
ahead I think the times are bright for movie theaters generally, and for AMC
individually, but we've got a debt there. We've got to out last it, and here's
how you out last it: you put money in the bank to out last it, 
// Or you just be cash flow positive which will be the case in 2023. Which means
// debt serviceability. 

// Red herring fallacy. Remember he was going to tell us why we needed to vote
// in favor for reverse-split-conversion. Instead he is going to tell us how we
// beat the shorts. Because we are fat we are too dumb to know (gaslighting.) 
// Even though, according to one of his recent tweets he is thinking about it. 
// He's trying to figure out how to do it, according to that tweet (that was 
// tweeted at nearly the same time that this speach was given. So after 2 years 
// of thinking about it now he's suddenly the expert, and so he's going to tell 
// us how to do it since he knows what he is doing. Even though according to his 
// tweet suggesting that he has no idea, and they are still just going to keep 
// thinking about it.
and a lot of you on Twitter, and other places keep on thinking how do you crush 
short sellers.

I'll tell you how you crush short sellers. You do so well in the performance of 
a company that the so-called short thesis that, "movie theaters are an 
anachronism, and are gonna die..." 
// The short thesis isn't, "Movie theaters are an anachronism, and are gonna
// die..." No short thesis with fact correspondent justification exists. 
// So he is already wrong due to a false assumption built into his flawed 
// premise.

that it just goes away, and so the way your beat them is to be strong, and the 
way to be strong: grow our revenues, grow our profits, and above all else make 
sure we have cash in the bank, 
// The order of priorities stated is false. Above all else the company needs to 
// be cashflow positive. In 2023 it will be cash flow positive.

and when you vote to put the APEs and AMC common shares back together again 
that's gonna allow us to raise cash to put money in the bank to make sure we can 
stare anyone in the eye, and say what do we say? We say, "choke on that." 
// So the reason we need to destroy the AMC short squeeze play by voting in 
// favor for RSC is just so we can say, "choke on that," to some people. Saying, 
// "choke on that," is how we crush the shorts. Adam knows what he is doing.
// Just trust your CEO. Why are you in AMC, if you don't trust your CEO? When
// we fuck ourselves by putting APE, and AMC back together then we will be able
// to say, "Choke on that," and saying, "Choke on that," totally caused HYMC to
// squeeze. You can't say, "Choke on that," now; it's impossible. That's why 
// MOASS hasn't happened yet. But once we wipe ourselves out with RSC for no
// reason, then we can say, "Choke on that," and that will cause MOASS. Man,
// Adam really knows what he is doing. What a brillant CEO! Why didn't our fat
// asses think of that?

So, that's the state of play at AMC guys. Uhh... We were in great shape.
// Yes. AMC is in great shape both fundamentally and financially. Demonstrated 
// by the research paper. So that PROVES this entire APE and RSC are both 
// nonsense, and have always been nonsense.

We were the biggest, and best movie theater chain in the world, and then Covid 
came. We're still the biggest, and best movie theater chain in the world, but 
Covid has knocked away a lot of our revenues because the movies weren't being 
released, but finally we're seeing big numbers in movies coming out.
// We were? 
// So that means RSC has no factual basis for justification. He just told you 
// the truth here. See the research paper for verification.

Our future is very bright, and uh... and we wouldn't be in this position to make 
it for another day, or another month, or another year if it weren't for all of 
you.
// How many appeal to vanity fallacies is that now? 

// OK he was going to tell us why we should vote yes, but instead we are going 
// to listen to him ramble about Twitter, and tweeting now. Is he even speaking
// in English?
I tweeted something just this morning, and like, probably many of you know that 
I'm active on Twitter. 'cause it's an opportunity for me t'a talk to you, and 
beleive it or not it's an opportunity for you to talk back. I I put out 6 tweets 
this morning... or today. Do you know how many replies I got today? 4,000 
individual replies t'a my tweets, and ya' know what I did before this... 
screening together tonight? I read all 4,000. It's abs-Ahh-E-um a lot of 'em, 
but it's easy to do 'cause they're like 200 and 80 characters. It's like 30 
words. That's Ess not a lot of... this is not a lot, ya' know, a lot of reading, 
but you kuh I can read... meuh my my little feeble mind and brain sometimes is 
weak, 
// You don't say? And given that you are aware of that, what reason do you have 
// to believe that you know what you're doing. Why isn't your little feeble mind
// and brain weak when pushing RSC yes votes to your unsuspecting shareholders?

but I can read 30 words really carefully, and really quickly, and if I 
gotta do it 4,000 times so be it, and 'cause it gives me a chance to hear what 
you're thinking, (audience cheering) and and when I tweeted this morning which 
is straight from my heart... is... what... gives me energy everyday... what 
drives me every single day... is knowing that you're out there, knowing that I 
have this support, knowing that you love this company, you're rooting for this 
company, you're on our side, and I'm on your side, 
// Appeal to pity fallacy; in other words, he says, "my job is really hard, woe
// is me, but I do it for you." If it sounds psychologically seductive that is 
// because it is; that is how an appeal to pity fallacy works. It's meant to 
// seduce the listner to the speakers persuasion. Not by reason, not by logic,
// but by eliciting an emotive response. Remember, he says he knows what he is
// doing. So he doesn't want you thinking; he just wants to trigger that 
// dopamine release so you blindly follow along with him.

and yeah it's true I sold some stock in 2021 which I told people I was gonna do 
months, and months, and months, in advance. 
// Epizeuxis; emotional appeal, setting the stage for the purpose of inspiring 
// motivation (to vote yes)
// He's the 5th largest AMC paperhand. First he paperhands all of his shares, 
// then when he runs out: he paperhands yours. This guy just can't get enough 
// of paperhands.

Um I was turning 68 years old in 2021, and I was tryin' to put my financial 
house in order. I did things like update my wills, set up trusts for my kids. 
Like I 'adn't done any of that stuff before, but it was time finally once-n-for 
all t'a acknowledge that I'm not 28 anymore, and like sometimes you gotta grow 
up and be an adult, but I haven't sold a share since January of 2022, 
// AMC took the hard hit within the time period that he started paperhanding his
// free shares, up until he stopped paperhanding on retail. That is, until he 
// issued APE; another really hard hit to retail. He knows what he is doing.

and uhh I had millions of shares in this company... (audience) (inaudible) 
...the largest individual investor in AMC. 
// He is not, and never was the largest individual investor in AMC. He was the 
// largest shareholder. Investors, by definition, put at risk their own capital 
// to buy shares. Adam made a relatively miniuscle investment. 93% of his shares 
// were free. Yes as part of his compensation as CEO, but he did not have to put
// at risk any thing to acquire those 93% of shares.

So make no mistake, if I had said I'm not selling any shares (mumbling) 
(inaudible) so make no mistake I believe in this company, I believe in its 
future, I get my energy from you, I've said, "I ride with you," and and... I 
mean it all, 
// Reminding you of his appeal to pity. So 5th largest paperhands is OK, because
// feel bad for him.

and with that as my little state of the union tonight... 

...here's wha' we're gonna do: Titanic is only the third highest grossing movie 
of all time. That's it. Just the third highest grossing movie of all time, and 
maybe the ship won't sink. I don't know yet.
// Is that double speak? Shilly AF much?

Um, and they're all rescued what a happy ending, but like it happened like 100 
years ago so we sort'a know what should've happened. Anyway, we're gonna watch 
the movie together, after the movie's over for those of you who just wanna 
leave... out the door ya' go over there, if ya' wanna stay and talk to me, take 
pictures, autographs, whatever you want... I'll stay all night. I got nothin' 
to do, but you. 
// He keeps the appeals to pity going. "I have no life without you."

I came to Phoenix for you guys tonight, and with that, before I cue the movie I 
just wanna make one thank you. Ya see some people standing in red over here. um 
this is... the bes... some of the management team at AMC Phoenix. Does a great 
dang team, an' I s specifically wanna call out one person in particular by name. 
Uhhh ta' say thank you to Pete for his hard work, and that of the whole team 
(audience shouting) (inaudible) ...has only been with AMC... for 45 years 
(audience shouting) (inaudible) ...and I think you have the highest seniority in 
the company. Yeah. So... (audience shouting) ...Pete's the man... (inaudible) 
(audience shouting) ...thank you for everything you've done for our company for 
half a century. Thanks to your team. Let's all enjoy James Camerons Titanic, all 
I'll see ya' after the movie's over. (audience shouting) (inaudible)
// Good job Pete! I like Pete. Adam? Not so much. But Pete is pretty cool! Save
// Pete: fire Adam!
